I used a Rasberry Pi 4 to create a portable router. I installed OpenWRT on the pi, and configured it to scan for nearby networks, and then once I chose which to use, 
transfer my internet actions through my router, and using the public wifi. This gives me the security of a firewall while also the low cost of public wifi. I have this router 
connected to a CISCO SF300 switch.
